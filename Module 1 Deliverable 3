# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Create a line chart from the pivot table to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month.
Create a line chart TO Visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I find that May is the launch month that have the peak outcomes, and it hits the lowest outcomes in Dec. 
There is an increase of successful outcome from Jan to Feb, May to May, Sep to Oct, but then there is a decline of outcomes from Feb to Mar, May to Sep, and from Oct to Dec. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The outcomes based on goals was a bit challenge for me, to understand the deliverable requriement clearly, and to use the countifs formula.
I joined office hour and get help from the TA.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
